This repository contains shell scripts for helping setup Jenkins to build and deploy WebObjects applications.

When combined with the corresponding Jenkins jobs (Jobs available in seperate repositories)* these scripts can:

1) Apple WebObjects™: 
  a) Download either WebObjects 5.3.3 or 5.4.3 from Apple 
  b) Install it in a version-specific location that will not conflict with other WebObjects installs - JENKINS_HOME/WOFrameworksRepository/WebObjects/VERSION

2) Project WOnder:
  a) Download Project WOnder source code by either
    • SVN: Checkout Project WOnder from old SVN repository
    • Git: Clone Project WOnder from the github.com repository
  b) Build any revision specified by the Jenkins job (does not need to build Head of Master)
  c) Install it in a revision-specific location so you can have several installed versions to build against - JENKINS_HOME/WOFrameworksRepository/ProjectWOnder/REVISION

3) Add any frameworks required by your project (based on the .classpath file) into your project's workspace (using symbolic links)
  a) WebObjects frameworks - based on the version specified in the Jenkins job
  b) Project WOnder frameworks - based on the revision specified in the Jenkins job

4) Build your WebObjects Framework or Application
  a) SVN: script is complete and working
  b) Git: could possibly use SVN script - but hasn't been specifically verified.

5) Deploy you WebObjects Application to a remote server running Wonder's JavaMonitor and wotaskd.**

* Jenkins job configuration files are available in seperate repositories (https://github.com/avendasora/WOJenkins_Job_InstallWOAndWOnder for example)

** Needs work. Use as a guide for now, probably doesn't work without customization.
